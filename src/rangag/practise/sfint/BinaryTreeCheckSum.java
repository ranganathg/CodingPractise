/**
 * 1. Given a binary tree, you need to check if it satisfies the specified property, 
 * The property is the value at the node should be equal to the sum of the values of its left 
 * and right subchild. If the tree doesn't satisfy the property, you need to update the 
 * values at the nodes to satisfy the property. The only restriction is you cannot 
 * reduce the value at any node
